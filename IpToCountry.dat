# This database is "DONATIONWARE"
# ===============================
#
# It's simple: we cannot offer tens of thousands of downloads per day without
# assistance. Please help us.... the PayPal link is near the top right of the
# page here: http://software77.net/geo-ip/
#
# If you use the database in a commercial application and therefore benefit
# financially we ask you to to make a small donation.
#
# If this database is anywhere half decent, pay what it's worth to you, as a
# developer or an end user.
#
# Our IPToCountry database is now part of many Linux and even WINDOWS
# distributions/packages. In other words, it comes included with the sofware
# the end user purchases and the end user is usually totally oblivious to this.
#
# It may be invisible to the user. S/he may not even know they have it on their
# PC, MAC, Tablet, Cellphone or other device; but be assured, this database
# is pervasive, and is to be found on many devices across the planet.
# As a tiny (truly tiny) company, we cannot support the world.
#
# We appeal to developers to make mention of the fact that this database
# is DONATIONWARE; many end user applications download the database weekly
# or even daily as part of the application and the end user is not even aware
# of the fact that they are making use of a resource entirely for free.
#
# HELP US! ... and make a small donation. And if you are a developer, make it
# known to your end users. Please.

# History
# =======
#
# The IPV4 database was first implemented in 2005 to offer a free alternative to
# the commercial databases that were available at the time. Today, there are
# literally hundreds of sources of "IP-to-Country" databases available. Many
# based on the data from this database.
#
# When we started this database we were amazed to find that almost 2 billion
# IP addresses in the IPV4 space had been assigned. Today, that figure is just
# over 3.5 billion. The database has grown from about 2MB unzipped
# to over 6MB. That's a lot of new assigned IP space for just a few years!
#
# In July 2010 an experimental version of the IPV6 database was released. It is
# available an two flavors -
#
# A database of IPV6 ranges
# A database in IPV6 CIDR format
#
# What this database is
# =====================
#
# This Database is operated and maintained by Webnet77 and updated every 24
# hours. It represents most of the IPV4 and IPV6 numbers in use on the Internet
# today and includes the IANA reserved IPs.
#
# This Database is automatically reconstituted every 24 hours by special
# software running on our servers. The top of the main page shows how long ago
# it was updated.
#
# Database download limit
# =======================
#
# We do limit downloads and lookups per IP per 3 hour period.
#
# We use a system of "hitpoints":
#
# a. You are allowed 250 hitpoints in any 3 hour period.
# b. An IP lookup costs 1 hitpoint(s).
# c. A complete Database download is 14 hitpoints
# d. If you exceed 250 hitpoints in any 3 hour period, you will not
#    be able to download or lookup anything until the full 3 hour period
#    has elapsed.
# e. Should you attempt further downloads while "banned", a weighting algorithm will
#    be applied to your IP address causing further time extensions.
# f. If you reach more than 900 hitpoints in 3 hours, your IP will be
#    banned for a v-e-r-y long time.
#
# PLEASE DO NOT ask us to remove your IP manually if you get banned. It's your job
# as a developer to make sure your IP does not get banned. Your IP will
# automatically be removed eventually depending on the above criteria.
#
# Unfortunately we have to do this as some "developers" have abused our resources
# in the past because their software went haywire and tried to download the
# database hundreds of times per minute essentially resulting in a denial of
# Service attack (granted - unintentional, but destructive nonetheless).
#
# For some this is a problem as certain ISP's (like AOL) proxy outbound users on a
# single IP and your download gets accumulated with others on the same IP. We
# wish we could help but unfortunately there is nothing we can do about that.
#
# A Request regarding automatic downloads
# =======================================
#
# If you are downloading automatically with a CRON job, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT
# set your download time to 00:00:00 (midnight). Please use some arbitrary time
# that is not 12 midnight. If everyone downloaded at exactly midnight, the
# download speed for all would slow to a crawl. Bottom line is to get the
# best speed, DO NOT download at midnight. Please choose an arbitrary
# time (especially the minutes).
#
# AUTOMATIC DOWNLOADS
# ===================
#
# To do an automated download with something like wget, use the following link
# format (some versions of wget may require you add the http:// prefix):
#
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=1 -O /path/IpToCountry.csv.gz      IPV4 gzip
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=2 -O /path/IpToCountry.csv.zip     IPV4 zip
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=3 -O /path/IpToCountry.csv.MD5     IPV4 MD5 (CSV file)
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=4 -O /path/IpToCountry.dat         IPV4 Geo::IPfree
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=5 -O /path/IpToCountry.dat.MD5     IPV4 MD5 Geo::IPfree
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=6 -O /path/country-codes.txt       Country Codes
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=7 -O /path/IpToCountry.6R.csv.gz   IPV6 Ranges
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=8 -O /path/IpToCountry.6R.csv.MD5  IPV6 Ranges MD5
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=9 -O /path/IpToCountry.6C.csv.gz   IPV6 CIDR
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=10 -O /path/IpToCountry.6C.csv.MD5 IPV6 CIDR MD5

# UPDATE LOG
# ==========
#
# June 2005    - Countries falling under AFRINIC now show correctly
#
# October 2006 - Many thanks to Lee Cjin Pheow from Singapore for this:
#                As of September 2006, Serbia and Montenegro now have new ISO
#                Country codes. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia and
#                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro.
#
#                We have updated the database to include "RS" and "ME" for these
#                two contries but currently the registries still provide the OLD
#                country code data. Thus you may need to translate the codes
#                "YU" and "CS" -> "ME" and the same for "ME".
#
#                For the most part it appears that translating CS -> RS and
#                YU -> ME works but it is probably not entirely accurate.
#
# Nov 2006     - Added country code for &Aring;LAND ISLANDS - AX - ALA
# Mar 2007     - Added Country code for JERSEY - JE - JEY
# Mar 2007     - Added ASCENSION ISLAND - AC (Reserved on request of UPU

#                (like AWSTATS). We now include the file in the correct format
#                to be used directly by these applictions.

#                Curacao
# Oct 2012     - Software was previously licensed as Gpl v3. However, this proved
#                to be somewhat restricting for some commercial developers. As of
#                now, the software is "DONATIONWARE" which basically means anyone
#                can use it anyway they want - commercial applications included.
#                All we ask in return is some reciprocation.
#                The donation link can be found near the top right on the main page:
#                http://software77.net/geo-ip/

# Nov 2013     - [v5.9.3] Cleaned up the DONATIONWARE License description
# Mar 2014     - [v5.9.4] Added referrer code to multi lookup tool
# May 2014     - [v5.9.5] 'Trying' to remove the "RE-CAPTCHA" on the Multi=IP lookup
#                Due to {not sure} some WordPress/Drupal/Joomla plugin that kills
#                this server DEAD. We have added a SHA512 key in a feeble attempt
#                to prevent remote calling of the MULTI-IP script. If you are one of
#                the people who wrote the WordPress/Drupal/Joomla etc.... plugin;
#                please discontinue it.... for now we have removed the RE-CAPTCHA;
#                Let us all play nice: if your customers need the DB, Download it
#                once / week. PLEASE, do not try to do it realtime via MULTI-LOOKUP!
# July 2014    - Many of the ISO 1366 codes we were using were outdated. These were
#                kindly pointed out by Niels Harland https://github.com/nielsharland,
#                And even more kindly he gave up a weekend to do much research
#                and provide us with an up to date country-codes.txt file. Niels,
#                thank you very much for your efforts!
# March 2015   - [v5.9.7] Data Collection Error Fixed Where Apnic And Afrinic Where
#                no longer collecting latest delegated lists correctly.
